This repository contains the MATLAB script CO2 quantity.m that calculates the required amount of CO2 for deploying the nose cone and the booster section of a high-powered rocket's ejection system. 
The script is designed for use in conjunction with CO2 ejection systems, which replace traditional black powder-based ejection systems in rocketry.

The script uses the ideal gas law to calculate the necessary amount of CO2 (in grams) based on the pressure needed to deploy the parachute via the nose cone and booster sections. 
Key inputs include the dimensions of the rocket sections, the forces exerted by shear pins, and drag forces on the rocket.
